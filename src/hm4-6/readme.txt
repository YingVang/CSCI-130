This is my aptempt at using Go to interface with mysql database.  I finally figured out how to connect 
go to the database.  With this file it will allow one to do querries using GO.  if this file is executed 
and they need to have a database called Game_Collection, and once it connects one can write querries.  

What I couldn't, and trying to figure out is how to connect this file to a website.

With authentiction, this database should have a "root" user and and empty password " " for it to be able
to connect.
